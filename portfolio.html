            <h3>Playroom</h3>
            <p class="portfoliocolumn">The purpose of this project was to design a playroom to my client's daughter.
                Principles of designing the playroom were its cost and budget. Low-budget means creativity and making things yourself.
                The parents' wished for good storage system, ease of cleaning and reconfigurability. Colors and small interior items were all child's choices.
                Type of furniture and materials choices and overall designing were left for me.
                Reconfigurability means that the room was decided to paint white.
                When the child grows older, it's much easier to change the furniture and decor when walls are neutral.
